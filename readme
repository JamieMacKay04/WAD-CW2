To run the site open the package.json file from the tree (near the bottom) and select debug (using either script start or dev will be fine)

The features I have implemented are

- Successful registration and login system with 3 types of users
- Home, About, Contact information/navigation pages
- A Profile page that changes based on the logged in user
- A Pantry page which shows different details based on user type
- The ability to submit food stuffs to the pantry
- The ability to select items as a pantry, which removes them from the database so other pantries dont take them
- The ability to delete users and pantry items as an admin
- Security measures to stop standard users accessing Pantry or Admin views
